Ivy, the Taggable Image Viewer
==============================

Ivy is an image viewer that allows the user to set or remove tags that are
tracked solely by the application. Ivy operates as follows:

- To add a tag or list of tags to an image, simply enter them into the tag text
  field, separated by commas. E.g. `flower,beach,common sense,roller coaster`

- To remove any set tags, simply enter an empty string in the tag text field and
the entry for that image will be deleted.

Ivy cannot display animation in gifs due to the nature of the GUI library, but
a static image will be displayed instead.
